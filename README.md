### Explain about first assignment and solution:
Decrypt the ciphertext into plaintext using a monoalphabetic cipher by applying letter frequency analysis and n-grams. The goal is to find the decryption key to convert the ciphertext into readable plaintext. The ciphertext consists of a simple substitution cipher, and decryption is performed using letter frequency analysis along with n-gram analysis.
